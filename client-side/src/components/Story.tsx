				There was once a woman who was very, very <input value={"cheerful"} />, though she
				had little to make her so; for she was old, and <input value={"lonely"} />. She
				lived in a little bit of a <input value={"cottage"} /> and earned a scant living by{" "}
				<input value={"running errands"} /> for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup
				there, as reward for her services. So she made shift to get on, and always looked
				<input value={"spry"} /> as if she had not a want in the world.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now one summer evening, as she was <input value={"trotting"} />, full of{" "}
				<input value={"smiles"} />, along the high road to her <input value={"hovel"} />,
				what should she see but a <input value={"big black pot"} /> lying in the ditch!
			</p>

			<p>
				"Goodness me!" she cried, "that would be just the very thing for me if I only had
				something to put in it! But I haven't! Now who could have left it in the ditch?"
			</p>

			<p>
				And she looked about her expecting <input value={"the owner"} /> would not be far
				off; but she could see nobody.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Maybe there is a hole in it," she went on, "and that's why it has been cast away.
				But it would do fine to put a flower in for my window; so I'll just take it home
				with me."
			</p>

			<p>
				And with that she lifted the <input value={"lid"} /> and looked inside. "Mercy me!"
				she cried, fair amazed. "If it isn't full of <input value={"gold pieces"} />. Here's
				luck!"
			</p>

			<p>
				And so it was, brimful of <input value={"great gold coins"} />. Well, at first she
				simply stood stock-still, wondering if she was standing on her head or her heels.
				Then she began saying:
			</p>

			<p>"Lawks! But I do feel rich. I feel awful rich!"</p>

			<p>
				After she had said this many times, she began to wonder how she was to get her
				treasure home. It was too heavy for her to carry, and she could see no better way
				than to tie the end of her <input value={"shawl"} /> to it and drag it behind her
				like a <input value={"go-cart"} />.
			</p>

			<p>
				"It will soon be dark," she said to herself as she trotted along. "So much the
				better! The neighbours will not see what I'm bringing home, and I shall have all the
				night to myself, and be able to think what I'll do! Mayhap I'll buy a{" "}
				<input value={"grand house"} />
				and just sit by the fire with a cup o' tea and do no work at all like a{" "}
				<input value={"queen"} />. Or maybe I'll bury it at the garden foot and just keep a
				bit <input value={"in the old china teapot"} /> on the chimney-piece. Or
				maybe—Goody! Goody! I feel that grand I don't know myself."
			</p>

			<p>
				By this time she was a bit tired of dragging such a heavy weight, and, stopping to
				rest a while, turned to look at her treasure.
			</p>

			<p>
				And lo! it wasn't <input value={"a pot of gold"} /> at all! It was nothing but{" "}
				<input value={"a lump of silver"} />.
			</p>

			<p>She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes, and stared at it again.</p>

			<p>
				"Well! I never!" she said at last. "And me thinking it was a{" "}
				<input value={"pot of gold"} />! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck!{" "}
				<input value={"Silver"} /> is far less trouble—easier to mind, and not so easy
				stolen. Them <input value={"gold pieces"} /> would have been the death o' me, and
				with this great lump of <input value={"silver"} /> -"
			</p>

			<p>
				So she went off again planning what she would do, and feeling as rich as rich, until
				becoming a bit tired again she stopped to rest and gave a look round to see if her
				treasure was safe; and she saw nothing but a great lump of <input value={"iron"} />!
			</p>

			<p>
				"Well! I never!" says she again. "And I mistaking it for <input value={"silver"} />!
				I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! It's real convenient. I can get penny
				pieces for <input value={"old iron"} />, and penny pieces are a deal handier for me.
				Why! I should never have slept a wink for fear of being robbed. But a penny piece
				comes in useful, and I shall sell that <input value={"iron"} /> for a lot and be
				real rich—rolling rich."
			</p>

			<p>
				So on she trotted full of plans as to how she would spend her penny pieces, till
				once more she stopped to rest and looked round to see her treasure was safe. And
				this time she saw nothing but a <input value={"stone"} />.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Well! I never!" she cried, full of smiles. "And to think I mistook it for{" "}
				<input value={"iron"} />. I must have been dreaming. But here's luck indeed, and me
				wanting a <input value={"stone"} /> terrible bad to stick open the gate. Eh my! but
				it's a change for the better! It's a fine thing to have good luck."
			</p>

			<p>
				So, all in a hurry to see how the <input value={"stone"} /> would keep the gate
				open, she trotted off down the hill till she came to her own{" "}
				<input value={"cottage"} />. She unlatched the gate and then turned to unfasten her
				shawl from the <input value={"stone"} /> which lay on the path behind her. Aye! It
				was a <input value={"stone"} /> sure enough. There was plenty light to see it lying
				there, douce and peaceable as should be.
			</p>

			<p>
				So she bent over it to unfasten the shawl end, when—"
				<input value="Oh my!" />" All of a sudden it gave a jump, a squeal, and in one
				moment was as big as a <input value={"haystack"} />. Then it let down four great
				lanky legs and threw out two long ears, nourished a great long tail and romped off,
				kicking and squealing and whinnying and laughing like a naughty, mischievous boy!
			</p>

			<p>
				The old woman stared after it till it was fairly out of sight, then she burst out
				laughing too.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Well!" she chuckled, "I am in luck! Quite the luckiest body hereabouts. Fancy my
				seeing the <input value={"Bogey-Beast"} /> all to myself; and making myself so free
				with it too! My goodness! I do feel that uplifted—that GRAND!"—
			</p>

			<p>
				So she went into her <input value={"cottage"} /> and spent the evening chuckling
				over her good luck.
