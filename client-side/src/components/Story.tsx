				Once upon a time, there lived a _creature1_ named __petName___. __petName_ was the
				loved friend of a __adj_ wizard named _2__. While the beginning of this story seems
				rather directed to the creature1, this wizard was not like any small town wizard
				that you might have heard about. This wizard was best known for their proficiency in
				__3__, where at any given moment, they would love to break conversation and give
				explicit detail about __3__. This is not to say that they were not truthful in their
				level of such a skill, not at all, they were entirely masterful. However, this fixed
				admiration would sometimes be to their own detriment, for they would be so happy
				partaking in this hobby, that they soon began to not think of anything else.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, back to __petName__. __petName__ decided one day to venture out and bring their
				friend to a lovely little _place___ deep in the forest that they had heard about
				from the other creatures in the land. It was said to be a marvel, filled with __4__
				and __5__ that one could never stop staring at, for as soon as they stepped into the
				vicinity, they were immediately enthralled in the wonder of the __place__.
			</p>
			<p>
				__petName__ packed up several ____ for the journey, and at the last moment
				(__specific time__) finally was able to drag _wizardName_ outside and to their
				adventure.
			</p>
			<p>
				{" "}
				Now, the path from their __home__ to _place_ was a _adj_ sort of road, where beings
				of magic and trickery would do anything to get an unfortunate traveler's attention.
				One such being, a _creature_, _past tense verb_ out in front of our heroes, and said
				to them “__phrase__”.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having no idea how to respond to this, _wizardName_ simply _verb_. The creature
				continued to rattle on, and not soon after, the wizard was pleased to realize that,
				since they had not left their _home_ since _season time_ and since they had never
				seen this creature before, then that meant that they most likely had never heard
				about _3_ before.{" "}
			</p>{" "}
			<p>
				Oh, how _wizardName_ delighted in their storytelling of _3_. They were enthralled in
				the ever careful art they loved so dearly, and despite _petName_ constantly tugging
				on their _outfit_ they would not stop.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				However, as the story continued, the wizard began to notice the glazed over look in
				this creature’s eyes, and wizardName_’s enthusiasm began to waver. Unfamiliar with
				this sensation since they found their love of this hobby, their heart began to
				_verb_.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				As _wizardName_ was caught up in this moment, and the fog in the creature’s eyes a
				perfect distraction, _petName_ was able to _adj_ lead wizardName away.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time they reached _place_, the wizard was _emotion_. Never before had they
				experienced their excitement for _3_ in such a way. They looked at the _4_ and _5_,
				the supposed wonders of this raved about spot, and thought “_phrase 2_”.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				petName _past verb_ wizardName on the back, and they both spent the rest of their
				journey _present v_.
